Graber E, Fujioka T. Endogenous Expectations for Sequence Continuation after Auditory Beat Accelerations And Decelerations Revealed by P3a and Induced Beta-Band Responses. Neuroscience. 2019 Jun 18.

The EEG recording sampling rate was 500.
There are three conditions in this experiment: acceleration, deceleration, and steady. 
All trials start with a brief visual cue indicating whether the beats will accelerate (arrow pointing up), decelerate (arrow pointing down), or remain steady (horizontal arrow with two heads) in a given trial.  
The researchers organized the trials in the following manner (participants did not know about this organization) 
After the visual cue, all trials start with an 'initial phase' consisting of three isochronous beats with an IOI of 600ms.
Next is the 'anticipation phase', consisting of 3, 6, or 9 isochronous beats (IOI remains 600ms).
After the 'anticipation phase' came the 'changing phase', consisting of 9 beats that either slowly accelerated the IOI to 450ms (or decelerated the IOI to 800ms), or remained steady.

There were also 10% 'target' trials where an IOI in the 'changing phase' was shortened by 200ms. This IOI occured randomly after the fifth through the eight beat of the 'changing phase'. Participants were instructed to press a button when they heard this shifted IOI.

Stimulus triggers for non-target trials are:

|		|Visual	|Initial|Anticipation	|Changing|
|---------------|-------|-------|---------------|--------|
|Accel short 	|117	|115	|111 		|110	 |
|Accel medium	|127	|125	|122 121	|120	 |
|Accel long	|137	|135	|133 132 131	|130	 |
|		|	|	|		|	 |
|Decel short 	|217	|215	|211 		|210	 |
|Decel medium	|227	|225	|222 221	|220	 |
|Decel long	|237	|235	|233 232 231	|230	 |
|		|	|	|		|	 |
|Steady short 	|61	|59	|55 		|54	 |
|Steady medium	|71	|69	|66 65		|64	 |
|Steady long	|81	|79	|77 76 75	|74	 |

And the stimulus triggers for target trials are:

|Accel short 	|119	|115	|111 		|11	 |
|Accel medium	|129	|125	|122 121	|12	 |
|Accel long	|139	|135	|133 132 131	|13	 |
|		|	|	|		|	 |
|Decel short 	|219	|215	|211 		|21	 |
|Decel medium	|229	|225	|222 221	|22	 |
|Decel long	|239	|235	|233 232 231	|23	 |
|		|	|	|		|	 |
|Steady short 	|63	|59	|55 		|31	 |
|Steady medium	|73	|69	|66 65		|32	 |
|Steady long	|83	|79	|77 76 75	|33	 |
